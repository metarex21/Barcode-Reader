# Barcode Reader

This is a Python script that decodes barcodes in images using the `pyzbar` library. The script is easy to use and requires only a few dependencies.

## Requirements

To run this script, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- PyZbar

You can install `cv2`, `NumPy`, and `PyZbar` using `pip`.

## Usage

To use the script, simply run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

`python barcode_reader.py --image [image_path]`


Replace `[image_path]` with the path to the image containing the barcode you want to decode.

The script will output the data stored in the barcode and display the image with a green rectangle around the barcode.
